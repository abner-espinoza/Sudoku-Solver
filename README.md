# Sudoku Solver

### Instructions
Interact with the Graphcial User Interface like you would with any Sudoku game. Simply click on a box, input a possible answer, and press 'return' to confirm. If your answer is correct the answer will be put in. Otherwise, a strike will appear at the bottom of the application. If you get stuck, press the space bar for the backtracking algorithm to do its magic and solve the puzzle for you.
